##  Features & Tasks Covered

The notebook walks through 20 progressive tasks:

### Beginner Tasks :
- Basic data exploration, filtering, and null checks.

###  Intermediate Tasks
- Feature engineering, aggregations, and distance calculations.

###  Advanced Tasks
- Temporal/spatial analysis, trip binning, and building a basic ML model for trip duration prediction.

##  Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark (PySpark)**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Python 3**
- Optional: GeoPandas / Shapely (for external geospatial mapping)

##  Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyspark-playground.git
   cd pyspark-playground/taxi_duration
   ```
